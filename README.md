# Overview

This repo contains code and data for forecasting the US 2020 presidential election. It was created by NAME. The purpose is to create a report that summarises the results of a statistical model that we built. Some data is unable to be shared publicly. We detail how to get that below. The sections of this repo are: inputs, outputs, scripts.

Inputs contain data that are unchanged from their original. We use two datasets: 

- Survey data (https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/nationscape-data-set)

  The national survey data chiefly used in the analysis is from Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape, one of the largest public opinion survey projects ever conducted. It  interviewed people in nearly every county, congressional district, and mid-sized U.S. city in the leadup to the 2020 election.
We use data collected in phrase 2 from June 25 to July 01, 2020 (N = 6,479 US Adults).

- ACS data (https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml)

IPUMS USA (originally, the "Integrated Public Use Microdata Series") is a website and database providing access to over sixty integrated, high-precision samples of the American population drawn from sixteen federal censuses, from the American Community Surveys of 2000-present, and from the Puerto Rican Community Surveys of 2005-present.

Outputs contain data that are modified from the input data, the report and supporting material.

- X, 
- Y

Scripts contain R scripts that take inputs and outputs and produce outputs. These are:

- 01_data_cleaning.R
- 02_data_preparation.R
